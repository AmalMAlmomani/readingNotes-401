## How to Solve Programming Problems:
  - You really want to make sure you take enough time to understand the problem completely before attempting to solve it.

  - Another big mistake is trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration.  Keep it simple, don’t try to get fancy.
    
    ### A simple set of steps:
      - 1. Read the problem completely twice.
         - most important step
         -  A good test of this is whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else.
      - 2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
         - ` "Nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually!" `
         - manual process which is the foundation of any code you write
      - 3. Optimize the manual steps.
         - What you want to do here is figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.
      - 4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
         - capture all the steps we created and now either put them into our editor as comments or write them as psuedo-code that we can translate to real code.
      - 5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
         - take each comment and convert it into a real line of code.
      - 6. Optimize the real code.
         - This is also a good place to make sure all your variables are named with long meaningful names.  I cannot stress enough how important having good names for your variables and methods is for helping the person evaluating your code to understand what you were trying to do.  This is especially important when you make a mistake!

## How to think like a programmer?
  - ` “Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.” — Steve Jobs `
  - Problem solving is the meta-skill

  ### what should you do when you encounter a new problem?
    - 1. Understand: Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them. 
    - 2. Plan: this means don’t start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.
    - 3. Divide: break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.
    - 4. Stuck?: 
       - Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging
       - Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
       - Research: Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions).
