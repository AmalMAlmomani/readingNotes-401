# Trees

## Common Terminology
  - `Node` - A node is the individual item/data that makes up the data structure
  - `Root` - The root is the first/top Node in the tree
  - `Left Child` - The node that is positioned to the left of a root or node
  - `Right Child` - The node that is positioned to the right of a root or node
  - `Edge` - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
  - `Leaf` - A leaf is a node that does not contain any children
  - `Height` - The height of a tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node

## Traversals
  - Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more! 
  - **There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:**
    - `Depth First`
      - Pre-order: root >> left >> right
      - In-order: left >> root >> right
      - Post-order: left >> right >> root
    - `Breadth First`

### Binary Search Trees
  - is a type of tree that does have some structure attached to it. In a BST, nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right.
